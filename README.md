Usage
--------------------------------------
After downloading the files, simply run the "Witcher3Map.cmd" file as an administrator. When you run "Witcher3Map.cmd" it will automatically install node.js, git and other dependencies (including grunt-cli which is not installed with npm install but required) if not installed. After the installations, it will automatically start the local server and open the map home page with the default browser and it will get its own window to the taskbar as well. After the first time, it will skip installations and open the map directly.

Also, with the "Uninstall.cmd" file, it will delete all applications installed with "Witcher3Map.cmd" and its own created registery key. If you have done any installations (node.js or git) before running "Witcher3Map.cmd", these installations will not be touched.

You can also access the exe verion from the [Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/6061).
