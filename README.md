The exe file opens the "index.html" file in the Dist folder with Portable Firefox in the Assets folder. "The Witcher 3 Map.ps1" file is the source code of the executable files.

Attention: The current version is only compatible with Firefox Legacy 52, if you update it, you may not be able to access the maps.
