## Witcher 3 Interactive Map

This is a follow on update to the map to modernize it's browser a little bit.  I was running into an issue where the portable Firefox that comes in the
original didn't quite run properly anymore.  This version comes with waterfox (a Firefox Fork) and I've cleaned up a lot of the extra unneeded files
from the repo.  To get this running do the following:

1. Clone the repo to your preferred location
2. Get into the assets folder and double click the waterfox-portable.exe, this will extract it in place
3. Run the executable for your platform labeled Witcher3Map.exe (or Witcher3Map(x86).exe)

I have kept the original README here for the credits and other information you may need at [this location](https://github.com/Griffen8280/witcher3map/blob/master/Original_README.md)
